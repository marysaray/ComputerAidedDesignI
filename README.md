Instruction is provided via the reverse classroom method. Tutorials and lecture content
will be posted online via canvas. Weekly Class meetings will be used to provide
coaching and dedicated time to work on the weekly lab assignment. After which there
will be open lab hours available for students to continue their work throughout the week.
Open lab hours will be posted on canvas and are subject to change through out the
quarter.

```
1. Employ safe practices while using fluid power, electrical, mechanical and control
equipment
2. Analyze the transmission of power between electrical, mechanical, and fluid power.
3. Use digital and analog controls on mechanical, electrical, fluid power, and hybrid
systems.
4. Construct complex machinery involving multiple forms of power and control.
5. Troubleshoot mechatronic systems, including the complex interplay between different
power and control variables.
6. Validate new and emerging power, control, and communication technologies.
7. Prioritize efficiency and environmental sustainability in mechatronic systems and
processes.
8. Prioritize social benefit from the perspective of mechatronic systems
